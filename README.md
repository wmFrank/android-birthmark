# A GUI-based Dynamic Birthmark Generation Method for Android Apps

## Intro
- Utilized birthmark technique to prevent Android applications from being tampered by people with vicious intentions.
- Designed an Interface-Style-Icon Tree using DFS on Android applications’ GUI, compared the icons’ style similarity between two
applications with Convolutional Neural Network, and concluded if one of them was the repacking version of the other.

## Note
We lost our original code because at that time we didn't use github to manage our code. This repo only contains first-edition paper and application for patent.
